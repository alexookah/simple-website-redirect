## Description
The **Simple Website Redirect** plugin allows to you redirect an entire website (except the WordPress admin) to another website.

The URL path and query string is preserved when redirecting to the new site. Ideally, the new site would handle any one-off redirects where a URL for an old page should point to a new page. The [Redirection](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/) plugin is great for this purpose.

### Pull Requests
All pull requests are welcome, although this plugin is relatively simple, so I'll probably be selective when it comes to features.
